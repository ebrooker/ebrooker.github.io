<P>
A part of my non-academic passions is music, I decided to share a bit about my gear,<BR>
the future of my musical pursuits and maybe even song demos once I get something of
salt recorded and processed!

This is my most recent bass guitar purchase. I'm very satisfied with the bass overall. Highly playable, excellent tones.<BR>
The stock factory strings take a little bit of playing to wear in as they initially have a really unfavorable twangy and<BR>
metallic sound to them. Works well with my Fender Rumble 25 Watt amp. <BR>

<A HREF="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/fender-rumble-25-1x8-25w-bass-combo-amp"> Fender RUMBLE 25 1x8 25W Bass Combo Amp </A><BR>Bought this amp with my Fender PJ bass from above. The amp is small and low wattage, but still packs <BR>
a mean punch. Pairs well with the PJ bass. Comes with a button switch for overdrive that sounds reasonably okay for the size<BR>
and price of the amp. Would recommend a dedicated overdrive pedal, though.<BR>

<A HREF="https://buildyourownclone.com/collections/bassfx/products/kuzco-jr-kit"> BYOC - Kuzco Jr. Fuzzy/Overdrive Pedal </A><BR>This is my first pedal, a DIY kit from Build Your Own Clone. It's a mini--pseudo-clone of the Way Huge Red Llama <BR> overdrive pedal, which is based on the Craig Anderton Tube Sound Fuzz. It's effectively a fuzzy-overdrive pedal and <BR> compatible with bass guitars. My first foray into putting together my own pedals, albeit, using a DIY kit. Practice with <BR>
soldering circuit components to PCBs was at least gained!<BR>
