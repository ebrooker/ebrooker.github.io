This is my most recent bass guitar purchase. I'm vary satisfied with the bass overall. Highly playable, excellent tones.<BR>
The stock factory strings take a little bit of playing to wear in as they initially have a really unfavorable twangy and<BR>
metallic sound to them. Works well with my Fender Rumble 25 Watt amp. <BR>

<A HREF="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/fender-rumble-25-1x8-25w-bass-combo-amp"> Fender RUMBLE 25 1x8 25W Bass Combo Amp </A><BR>Bought this amp with my Fender PJ bass from above. The amp is small and low wattage, but still packs <BR>
a mean punch. Pairs well with the PJ bass. Comes with a button switch for overdrive that sounds reasonably okay for the size<BR>
and price of the amp. Would recommend a dedicated overdrive pedal, though.
