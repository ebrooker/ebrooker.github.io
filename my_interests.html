        Hi, I'm Ezra Brooker. I'm a fresh off the press graduate student. 
        PhD/Masters student at Florida State Universty, Department<BR>
        of Scientific Computing. <BR>
        <BR>
        My academic interests are primarily focused on the computation
        and data analysis aspects of astrophysical problems. Particularly<BR>
        I'm infatuated with supernovae, stellar formation, black holes,
        and galaxy formation. I'm also fond of plasmas, hydrodynamics, MHD,<BR>
        acoustics, circuits, and general numerical methods.<BR>
<BR>
        My current research group focuses primarily on supernovae with
        an even more specific focus on the different components behind<BR>
        Type Ia SNe. My PhD project is still under construction, but it
        is likely to be a continuation of one of my predecessors work on<BR>
        Double Degenerate Type Ia scenarios, testing various configurations
        for theorized detonation triggers.<BR>
<BR>
        Python 2.7/3.6, Fortran 90/95, and C/C++ are my primary languages at
        this time, your typical Romance languages.<BR>
<BR>
        Outside of academia, I have a huge passion for music, both listening, 
        playing, and creating. In my spare time and as a stress relief from the<BR>
        presssures of life, I play and record music. I'm currently investing a
        little bit of time working with one of my longtime colleagues on a<BR>
        recording project, although my academic responsibilities are putting
        very unforgiving boundary conditions on the evolution of this recording<BR>
        project. Related to my music passion, I'm starting to spend the other half
        of my preciously scarce free time building effects pedals for guitars and <BR>
        bass guitars.<BR>
<BR>
        Other pursuits include extensive reading (more than just research publications),
        cooking, exercising, and breathing.<BR>
