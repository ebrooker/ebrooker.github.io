<P> Florida State University <BR>
        Hi, I'm Ezra Brooker. I'm a fresh off the press graduate student. 
        PhD/Masters student at Florida State Universty, Department of <BR>
        Scientific Computing. <BR>
<BR>
        My academic interests are primarily focused on the computation
        and data analysis aspects of astrophysical problems. Particularly<BR>
        I'm infatuated with supernovae, turbulent combustion, cosmic dust 
        formation, hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. I also have an <BR>
        an interest in learning more about acoustics and circuits although
        that may be in part influenced by my love of music and guitars... <BR>
        Aside from explicit physics applications, I enjoy programming and
        and implementing numerical methods to solve various problems.<BR>
<BR>
        My current research group focuses primarily on supernovae with
        an even more specific focus on the different components behind<BR>
        Type Ia SNe. My PhD thesis is centered around solving the
        mysteries of the Type Ia detonation mechanism and how the <BR>
        deflagration-to-detonation transition plays a role in the
        successful detonation of a white dwarf star.<BR>
<BR>
        I have also spent the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2020 working as 
        as an intern with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) on an <BR>
        astrophysics project focused on the formation of cosmic dust in
        the outflows of core-collapse explosions of dying very massive stars.<BR>
<BR>
        Python 2.7/3.6, Fortran 90/95 through 2018 standards, and C/C++ are<BR>
        my primary languages at this time. I'm familiar with Matlab, BASH 
        scripting, and writing reports in LaTeX.<BR>
<BR>
        Outside of academia, I have a huge passion for music, both listening, 
        playing, and creating. In my spare time and as a stress relief from the<BR>
        pressures of life, I play and record music. I'm currently investing a
        little bit of time working with one of my longtime colleagues on a<BR>
        recording project, although my academic responsibilities are putting
        very unforgiving boundary conditions on the evolution of this recording<BR>
        project. Related to my music passion, I'm starting to spend the other half
        of my preciously scarce free time building effects pedals for guitars and <BR>
        bass guitars.<BR>
<BR>
        Other pursuits include extensive reading (more than just research publications),
        cooking, exercising.<BR>
