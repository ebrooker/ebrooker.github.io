        Hi, I'm Ezra. I'm a fresh off the press graduate student. 
        PhD/Masters student at Florida State Universty, Department
        of Scientific Computing.

        My academic interests are primarily focused on the computation
        and data analysis aspects of astrophysical problems. Particularly
        I'm infatuated with supernovae, stellar formation, black holes,
        and galaxy formation. I'm also fond of plasmas, hydrodynamics, MHD,
        acoustics, circuits, and general numerical methods.

        My current research group focuses primarily on supernovae with
        an even more specific focus on the different components behind
        Type Ia SNe. My PhD project is still under construction, but it
        is likely to be a continuation of one of my predecessors work on
        Double Degenerate Type Ia scenarios, testing various configurations
        for theorized detonation triggers.

        Python 2.7/3.6, Fortran 90/95, and C/C++ are my primary languages at
        this time, your typical Romance languages.

        Outside of academia, I have a huge passion for music, both listening, 
        playing, and creating. In my spare time and as a stress relief from the
        presssures of life, I play and record music. I'm currently investing a
        little bit of time working with one of my longtime colleagues on a
        recording project, although my academic responsibilities are putting
        very unforgiving boundary conditions on the evolution of this recording
        project. Related to my music passion, I'm starting to spend the other half
        of my preciously scarce free time building effects pedals for guitars and 
        bass guitars.

        Other pursuits include extensive reading (more than just research publications),
        cooking, exercising, and breathing.
